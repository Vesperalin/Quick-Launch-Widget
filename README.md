## User's manual
By clicking one of the four icons you will be redirected to chosen website.

The widget can be easily moved. Just press the widget's background, drag and drop. 

To close the widget right click the background and choose "Exit" option.

## More information
After pressing any icon it's background will change colour. After releasing the background will resume to initial colour and then redirect to website.
